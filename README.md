FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL DISTRESS

With a dataset of 322 companies from 2014 to 2023, this study provides empirical information on the relationship between financial indicators and financial distress. Specifically, Return on Assets (ROA) and the current liquidity ratio are inversely related, while financial costs are positively related to the measure of financial distress. Additionally, the study explores the impact of CEO characteristics on company financial distress, contributing several new findings and insights:

CEO characteristics such as gender and educational background influence financial distress. Companies with female CEOs and CEOs with postgraduate education tend to experience lower financial distress. These findings are useful for shareholders when deciding on the appropriate management for a company. If shareholders are willing to accept more risk to seize more opportunities, they should choose younger CEOs with a bachelor's degree or lower, as they are likely to take more risks in investment decisions. Furthermore, shareholders should consider the gender of the CEO, as female CEOs often manage risk more cautiously and make less risky financial decisions. They may focus on maintaining financial stability and sustainability rather than pursuing short-term, high-risk growth opportunities. Having a female CEO can also bring benefits from diversity and inclusion perspectives, fostering a more positive and innovative work environment. This not only improves performance and reduces financial distress but also enhances the companyâ€™s reputation and brand value.

To minimize the likelihood of financial distress, the study suggests that companies focus on optimizing production and business processes to improve asset utilization, thereby increasing Return on Assets (ROA). Companies need to maintain reasonable liquidity by effectively managing receivables, payables, and keeping adequate cash reserves to cover short-term debts. Utilizing financial tools such as short-term credit lines or effective cash flow management, adjusting fixed asset investment trends to align with risk control capabilities, and reducing financial cost burdens by restructuring debt, renegotiating loan terms for lower interest rates, or seeking equity financing instead of debt are recommended. Companies may also use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks. Moreover, the study suggests that companies should be mindful of the economic disadvantages of scale, opt for appropriate scale growth limits, and proactively accumulate financial management experience, including risk management. The proposed measures will help Vietnamese companies reduce the risk of financial distress, improve operational efficiency, and ensure sustainable long-term development. Companies need to research and implement measures suitable to their specific financial and economic situations.
